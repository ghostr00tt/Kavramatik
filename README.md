# Smart-Bliss-Board-System-for-Children-with-Special-Needs
At present, the Bliss symbols are printed on hard board. When using this printed Bliss board in the classroom, the teacher/tutor must concentrate each multiple differently abled child separately to understand his/her expression using Bliss symbols. This is the main problem in their teaching and learning of multiple differently abled children. Basically, they use a head attached stick for touching each bliss symbols on a Bliss board. This is a difficult task for physically differently abled children to use this Bliss board and also multiple differently abled children are unable to use new technology such as send emails, chatting etc. due to their disabilities. Literature survey found that the other similar systems for Bliss symbolic language learning are also difficult for use by physically challenging children because they are unable to access modern devices such as a computer or mobile phones directly. But in this research mainly consider about treating the mentally wellbeing children having physical disabilities(handicapped) or those who have communication disorder like deaf/ vocal disabled.
